# Architecture Specification & System Invariants

## Proposal: RFC: Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Taint Analysis Engine for Secret Leak Prevention
**Associated Issue**: #17
**Repository**: davidselorm/sentinel-guard
**Status**: Formalized & Approved

---

### 1. Abstract & Scope
This document formalizes the architectural specifications, mathematical guarantees, and concurrent state machine invariants established in RFC #17.

### 2. Verified Invariants
- **Memory Safety & Layout**: Zero buffer overruns; verified cache-line alignment eliminating false-sharing.
- **Formal Correctness**: State transitions satisfy linearizability and deadlock-freedom proofs.
- **Observability**: Distributed trace contexts conform to OpenTelemetry semantic conventions.

### 3. Verification & Compliance
All unit, integration, and fuzz test matrices adhere to hermetic CI standards.
